Title: Breast Cancer Detection 

Overview: Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes. Machine learning offers a powerful tool to assist in the early diagnosis of breast cancer by analyzing various factors and patterns in medical data.

In this project, we have utilized the Logistic Regression algorithm to classify breast cancer cases as either malignant or benign based on features extracted from diagnostic images and patient data.

Environment: The development environment for this project is Google Colaboratory, a cloud-based platform that provides convenient access to computational resources, including GPUs, making it suitable for training machine learning models.

Dataset: The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle, a popular platform for datasets and data science competitions. It consists of diagnostic data, including features extracted from digitized images of breast tissue and clinical information about patients.
